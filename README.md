# Hey, my name is Ashton!
I participate in both the FIRST Robotics Competition (as a programmer on FRC Team 1165 - Team Paradise), and in the FIRST Tech Challenge (alumni of FTC Team 11794 - Sunrise Koolbotics, member of unregistered rookie team). Most of what I do here is likely related to one of these two teams, but I like to explore and do other things too!
