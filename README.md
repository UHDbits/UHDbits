# Hey, my name is Ashton!
I participate in both the FIRST Robotics Competition (as the Lead of Software on FRC Team 1165 - Team Paradise), and in the FIRST Tech Challenge (alumni of FTC Team 11794 - Sunrise Koolbotics, Outreach Lead of FTC Team 25620 - Hexadecimal Nibble). Most of what I do here is likely related to one of these two teams, but I like to explore and do other things too!
